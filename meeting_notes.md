
## Research question

Today 's meeting was mostly on clarifying the reseach question and we came up with the following which is from  Sylvie's understanding.

 We  want to determine the distribution of outbreaks of a specific size and in order to do that, Prof Juliet suggested to:

- first simulate many outbreaks ("real world scenario") to get some specific values such as the reproduction number or the spillover rate
- then we vary some "parameter of the model" such as the size of the outbreaks in a fix duration ( per year) of we vary the  time duration (n = 1, 2, 3  years ) and we estimate for each value of n ("index scenario") the value of the reproduction number and spillover rate. 
- For each value of n, we want to determine the probability of having an outbreak of a given size.  The choice of the sizes to consider here will depend on the existing sizes in the real worl scenario. 
- We want to compare the probabilities obtained in the real world scenarion and in the index scenario by using a QQ plot for example (just a suggestion for now). For this we need to determine how estimates be classified as  good or bad.
- we want to add a detection filter whose values might represent different cases. Higher values of the filter might represent the case where  the idea of getting money from the insurance company motivate people or countries to increase the effort in finding outbreaks.   
 The picture attached  represents the explanations made by Prof Juliet on the board.
