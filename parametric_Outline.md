# Assessing the feasability of parametric insurance for zoonotic outbreaks  #

Many highly lethal pathogens, such as Ebola, Lassa, and Nipah viruses, cause repeated outbreaks in
people through a process of "zoonotic spillover" (i.e., animal-to-human transmission), followed by some
degree of onward human-to-human transmission. Outbreaks of such diseases require a swift response
in order to minimize their public health and economic impacts. Developing insurance products that
support country-level responses to such outbreaks could provide a mechanism that both motivates
national investment in outbreak preparedness and facilitates rapid deployment of resources in the event
of an outbreak.

## Objective

**The main objective of this project is to develop a reliable index
of the probability of outbreak events of different sizes, based on currently available information on
specific pathogens combined with epidemiological models.** This project would begin with a feasibility
assessment of such a parametric approach to developing a risk index for zoonotic outbreaks, using
Ebola, Lassa, and Nipah as case studies, using simulation-based validation methods. 

## Plan
#### Definition and formulation of useful concepts
- Parametric insurance (ARC definition ?)
- Parametric trigger (ARC definition ?) 

 It is based on confirmed cases and deaths over a prescribed period of time (WHO definition)

- Parametric model: Uses dynamic information captured through data to evaluate risk (or make prediction)
- Parametric instrument: Bases payoffs on measures correlated with loss and not directly on loss.
- Risk index:
- Risk profile
####Simulation based validation approach
We can start with a model (stochastic ?) of a disease (Ebola or Nipah) dynamic that includes the following aspects 

-  Spillover rate
-  Human R0 ( spatio-temporal variations)
- Something about response
- The size of the "effective population susceptible"
- Detection rate
- Branches process models
- Generation based processes
- Distribution of population sizes


##Litterature review

### Pandemic Emergency  Financing Facility: A parametric insurance developped by the World Bank. 
- How does it work ?
- what are the parameters that trigger a payout ? 
- how is the risk index calculated ?
