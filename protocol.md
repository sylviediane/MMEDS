# Assessing the feasability of parametric insurance for zoonotic outbreaks  #

Many highly lethal pathogens, such as Ebola, Lassa, and Nipah viruses, cause repeated outbreaks in
people through a process of "zoonotic spillover" (i.e., animal-to-human transmission), followed by some
degree of onward human-to-human transmission. Outbreaks of such diseases require a swift response
in order to minimize their public health and economic impacts. Effective response to disasters in general 
is  at the center of the  Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030, endoresed  by the United Nations in 2015, which aims at  reducing disaster risk and damage in lives, health, economic assets by strenghtening disaster risk governance and  investing in disater risk reduction for resilience [https://www.unisdr.org/we/coordinate/sendai-framework]. Risk reduction and rick transfer are linked through  insurance product. In fact,
risk reduction lowers hazard losses so that  the financial contribution paid  by an insured party to the ensurer is also reduced. Insurance subscription can therefore be used as a tool in disaster risk reduction in general and also in outbreaks risk reduction. Late and insufficient response to recent outbreaks, especially in developping countries,  has raised the question of  preparedness of states when it comes to stopping those outbreaks and which can be addressed by developping insurance products specific to outbreaks risk. So, 
Developing insurance products that
support country-level responses to such outbreaks could provide a mechanism that both motivates
national investment in outbreak preparedness and facilitates rapid deployment of resources in the event
of an outbreak.
Deployment of resources can be done thanks to  payouts from an insurer after a loss event or an outbreak has occured. But  the time spent in the evaluation of damage and cost, creates a gap in financing the response to an outbreak or a disaster which can increase the damage. It is therefore necessary to develop insurance products with  rapid payouts in other to implement swift response to outbreaks. 


 Parametric or index-based insurance is a type of insurance with a pre-agreed payment structure based on an index
that eliminate complexities of a loss investigation process and speed up the indemnification process [https://corporatesolutions.swissre.com/insights/knowledge/what_is_parametric_insurance.html]. It is then  a good tool
that can help in improving the level of  preparedness of countries towards naural hazard and disease outbreaks.

Following an Ebola outbreak that killed 11 000 people in West Africa, the African Ministries of Finance requested the African Risc Capacity (ARC) to develop a product to address the financing needs of Member Countries to contain public health emergencies arising out of infectious diseases that are common on the continent.  The ARC agency accepted the challenge and is actually designing a parametric insurance product through the Outbreak and Epidemic Insurance programme [https://www.africanriskcapacity.org/product/outbreaks-and-epidemics/].  
 
# from the ARC perpective, what is needed to  produce the parametric insurance and how does our work fit into reaching that objective (risk index, we will work on the evaluation of the risk index, how accurate it is at representing african outbreaks)?
#what do we plan to do exactly?

## Objective

**The main objective of this project is to develop a reliable index
of the probability of outbreak events of different sizes, based on currently available information on
specific pathogens combined with epidemiological models.** This project would begin with a feasibility
assessment of such a parametric approach to developing a risk index for zoonotic outbreaks, using
Ebola, Lassa, and Nipah as case studies, using simulation-based validation method.
